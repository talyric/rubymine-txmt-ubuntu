# rubymine-txmt-ubuntu
Have Rubymine handle the 'txmt' scheme in Ubuntu.  Very useful for [Better Errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors), [Xray-rails](https://github.com/brentd/xray-rails) and other gems!

## Installation
Clone the repo, change to the project directory, and run the following.

    ./install.sh

## Tip
[Not related to this project] When using Xray-rails, the application must still be running or it won't do anything.
