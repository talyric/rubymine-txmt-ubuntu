# rubymine-txmt-ubuntu
Have Rubymine handle 'txmt' scheme in Ubuntu.  Very useful for [Better Errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors), [Xray-rails](https://github.com/brentd/xray-rails) and other gems!

## Installation
clone, change directory, and run `./ install.sh`

Inspired by this [gist](https://gist.github.com/gregd/1305906).
